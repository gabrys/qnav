- Due to the Line-Drawing-SpeedUp when manually panning around the invisible part gets into the visible rect
- Possibility to insert usermade turn-voices (maybe through SD-card)
- maybe add a "123..."-key that makes the Numbers in Non-Number-keyboards appear on demand
- Somehow give the user the possibility to check whether the found route is found for the first time. (like having a short static preview over the found route, before the realtime-navigation part starts)  
- TracePolicy also for AndNav1
- Colorschemes also for AndNav1
- On First Run, Ask user if he wants to place a shortcut to the HOME-Screen
- Maybe make the 'Quick-Renderer-Chooser' as a ContextMenu instead of an AlertDialog, so SpannableString would be supported.

- Having the preload-dialog canceled, it should be made revisible again using the same menu-button
- Old MapTiles should get invalid after a week or two (only if they can be re-downloaded)
(- Check if 'outdated-maptile'-redownloading works.)
- Submit AndNav2 to the TTS-Application-Showcase of the TTS-lib 
- Resend failed traces later on (to OSM).
- Enable Perspective-View when Camera-Class in SDK is working again. 
- With saved routes, just ask for RealTime or Static Nav, nothing else(?).
- Altitude profile also for hand-drawn lines on WhereAmI.
- Add option to altitude-api to add a 'current position' marker in the generated image.
- Add android:hint were possible

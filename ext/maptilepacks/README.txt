Hello AndNav2-User,

thank you for using our application, we hope it saved you some time and money =)


MapTile-Pack installation.

[1.] Connect your Android Device to your PC
[2.] A notification on your Android Device will ask you if you want to 'Mount' your SD-Card to your PC. Select 'Mount'/'Yes'.
[3.] If not already present, create a folder called "andnav2/tiles" directly on your SD-Card.
[4.] Unzip the contents of the MapTilePack you have downloaded to the folder "andnav2/tiles"
[5.] You should now see files like "andnav2/tiles/mapnik/0/0/0.png.andnav" on your SD-Card.
[6.] AndNav2 will now use those MapTiles =)

That's it =)

Best Regards,
The andnav.org Team

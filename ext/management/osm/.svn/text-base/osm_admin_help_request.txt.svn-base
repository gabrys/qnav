Hello lambertus,

my name is Nicolas Gramlich and I have done an Navigation-Application for Google Android, called AndNav ( http://www.andnav.org/ ). Unfortunately there are licensing issues with Google, which made me to switch over to OSM.

So for now I have done a soon-open-source component for Android to display the MapTiles and some public code to contribute back to the osm-project.
So the last thing I'd need is the actual routing part.

The reason why I am contacting you is because you have set up this neat website: http://www.yournavigation.org/

My questions are (I'd be really happy if you could answer them):
1. Should I set up my own MapTile-Server? Because currently I'm loading them from the same sources the osm-mainpage does (I do caching).
2. What would you suggest for setting up a routing-server (Gosmore or pyroutlib2)? I simply need sth that creates the route from CoordsA to CoordsB. GPX returndata would be perfect.
3. Do you know a person (maybe yourself), that could assist me in setting up a server for maptiles and routing?
4. Can I make my app commercial?

Looking forward to any response.

Best Regards,
Nicolas Gramlich
